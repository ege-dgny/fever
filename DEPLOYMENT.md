```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

   - `https://your-project.web.app`
   - or `https://your-project.firebaseapp.com`

### Option 3: Netlify

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Drag and drop your `dist` folder after building
   - OR connect GitHub for automatic deployments

## üîó How Shareable Links Work

When you create a room, you can share the game in two ways:

1. **Room Code:** Share the 6-digit code
2. **Direct Link:** Click the share button to get a link like:
   ```
   https://your-game.vercel.app/join/ABC123
   ```

When friends click the link:
- If not logged in ‚Üí They enter their name first
- Automatically joins the room
- Real-time sync via Firebase

## üéÆ Game Persistence

- **Games persist** as long as you want in Firebase
- **No time limits** - play at your own pace
- **Rejoin anytime** with the same room code
- **Turn-based or real-time** - works both ways
